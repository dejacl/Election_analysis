### Election audit summary
The election Commission could use this script moving forward for other elections with just simple modifications. Ways the script could be used in other elections is by simply changing where the source of data is being pulled from ie:( file_to_load ) and (file to save) so with modifications to these files a simple change can be made. The dependencies a could be another way to modify this script. Due to the script having comments is another way to modify the document to remove items that the Commission would not want to use in the next election. The comments make the script user friendly.
